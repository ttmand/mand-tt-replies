    <p>Notes for anyone reading this :P - this is basically a list of all my replies on the forum. I use this to find some of my previous posts, or to find threads that I have posted in etc. Every time I post a reply on the forum, I then add it here</p>
    <p>This only shows my posts from 2024 and after. Not my posts from 2018 - 2023.</p>

<p class="m">In my opinion, that would spoil the simplicity of the game. If we start adding things like that, I feel the game would lose its uniqueness a bit. Though hopefully we might get some more weapons in the future!</p>

<h3 class="t">Replying to: <a href="https://tanktrouble.com/forum?threadId=471614" target="_blank">Homing Missle</a> (LongDen)</h3>
<p class="m">There are six achievements relating to the homing missile.</p>
<p class="m">- Homecoming</p>
<p class="m">- Close To Home</p>
<p class="m">- Home Is Where The Missile Is</p>
<p class="m">- No Assistance Needed</p>
<p class="m">- Indecisive</p>
<p class="m">- Favourite Destination</p>
<p class="m">The first three are achieved by destroying a certain number of tanks using the homing missile. The others are secret - so I can't reveal the exact method. I would suggest using the missile as much as possible to maximise your chance of getting it, and try different techniques with it. Also, it might be useful to create/join a game which only has homing missiles.</p>
<p class="m">The names of the achievements are actually pretty good hints though :P</p>

<p class="m">I have had a similar issue, which I think is related to the update that the developers released yesterday. Unfortunately, if that's what's causing your problem, I don't know how to fix it. For me, closing the browser and reopening it sometimes seems to work, though not always.</p>
<p class="m">When was it last working fine for you? If it has just been a problem today/yesterday, it is likely due to the new update.</p>
<p class="m">I'd suggest clearing your cache, and checking your internet connection. Although if it's just the game tab that isn't loading, it's unlikely to be an internet problem.</p>

<p class="m">Shockwave44's thread was created in 2018, and Dalek-Buster confirmed that he was retired in 2019. This makes EPIC_GIRL's answer incorrect. But we've yet to establish whether the question is valid. As far as I am aware, there was no easy way for people to find the thread. In a game, you said that the thread was Shockwave44's last post on the forum. If that was true, it would make it rather easy to find the thread. However, his last post was in August 2021.</p>

<p class="m">The question specifically asked what year he retired. If that screenshot is accurate, and was taken today, then he retired between 7 and 8 years ago. Which could be anything between 28th January 2018 and 28th January 2019. So the answer would either be 2018 or 2019.</p>

<p class="m">@kamarov Yes, the question asked for the name of the server. But when I asked for the answer, you said it is "Søren Boll Overgaard" - and then cited a sentence on the Classic website. But it is highly likely that the sentence on Classic is intended to imply that "Søren Boll Overgaard" is the creator of the server, or the person responsible for it - not the name of the server. So, the crucial thing is that we haven't established what the name of the server is yet. Please correct me if I have misunderstood something.</p>

<p class="m">@TripleStryke As far as I am aware, there are 4 TTOC gamemodes per year. Each gamemode offers a 1st place prize of 1,100 dimitrium, or (500 dimitrium + premium). If a player wins every gamemode for four years, the player would receive 17,600 dimitrium (1100*16) if they didn't choose premium, but they would receive 17,000 ((1100*15)+509) if they choose premium. By multiplying that number by the number of gamemodes they played (16), the answer is 272,000. Have I misunderstood the way TTOC prizes are awarded? Other than that, I can't see how the answer could be incorrect.</p>

<p class="m">3w0n's question asked how many threads were created in 2025. It is possible to find out a fairly accurate answer to that. The same could be said for most other years. However, your question asked how many threads had been created "as of" 2024. This is technically asking how many threads had ever been created, up until 2024. This might not have been the intended question, but that is technically what the question asks.</p>

<p class="m">I agree, the question asks specifically for the name of the server. What I mean is that I can't understand how the sentence underneath the classic game implies that the name of the server is "Søren Boll Overgaard". As everything else in that sentence is giving credit to people for each thing that is mentioned, surely this is no different?</p>

<p class="m">If "server" refers to the technology that is used, for example, the technology that hosts the website, there is no evidence so far that the name of it is boll2's name</p>
<p class="m">If you're suggesting that boll2 himself is a "server", as a different definition of the word "server", I think the question was misleading.</p>

<p class="m">@kamarov I don't think it means that's the name of the server. In the screenshot, it also says "Design: Mads Purup, Programming: Brian Bunch Christensen". That is saying that purup and bbc are responsible for design and programming, respectively. It then says "Server: [boll2]". If it's consistent with everything else that is written in the same sentence, then it means that boll2 is responsible for the server - it doesn't imply that his name is also the name of the server.</p>

<p class="m">I know that the question specified "how many times", but Galatasaray did in fact state the correct answer (42). There are 42 occurrences of deathmatch per week - and as deathmatch lasts an hour, each hour of deathmatch is one occurrence. I think in this case, it is possible to interpret "hour" as an occurrence of deathmatch, i.e. 42 is the number of times there has been an "hour of deathmatch", rather than interpreting it to be stating the total duration of deathmatch per week.</p>

<p class="m">@Galatasaray This question is not valid, as it is too vague. It doesn't specify whether it's the thread itself without replies, or including all the replies. I also don't think it's fair to expect people to count all the letters. And also, if it includes replies, there is no fixed answer to that question. If someone replies with the correct answer, they will be adding more letters - thus making the answer incorrect.</p>

<p class="m">@Purity That's incorrect. There are 118 country flags in the shop. However, the question didn't state which kinds of flags are included - so it must therefore include other flags as well, such as the TTOC flag and the 4th July flag, etc. Galatasaray receives 5 points.</p>

<p class="m">Clearly the rules are being manipulated here - though I must take some responsibility for this, as I specifically did say (while in a game) that this sort of thing is technically fine. Although I could see that it is not very good, I thought it would be unfair to change the rules at this point, given that some players have now benefitted from it. However, it is clear that it if it continues, it will spoil the game completely, which would be worse. Therefore, I have decided that henceforth, only one guess is permitted per player for each question. If you post more than one valid answer, your most recent answer given will be taken.</p>
<p class="m">This will apply for the next question and onwards. It does not apply to the current question, as it had already been asked before this change.</p>

<p class="m">To collect a million in the mazes would take 47.5 years at the very minimum. And that would only be possible if you were farming 24/7, *and* the dimi always spawned in the minimum time.</p>

<p class="m">@DoomBold As Novocaine said, it would be a different ID. The ID of the account that created the thread is "4780266", and that account wasn't created until 2018. When a tank is scrapped, any posts they have made lose the "creator" value in the data, which means their tank will show as "Scrapped".</p>
<p class="m">@Sheep in my screenshot above, there is a line that says:</p>
<p class="m">' "moderatedBy" : "3162693", '</p>
<p class="m">This shows us who approved the thread - and 3162693 is Commander's ID.</p>

<p class="m">@sheep @Dalek-Buster @Mad</p>
<p class="m">This is an interesting discovery :P</p>
<p class="m">https://prnt.sc/ux2ACeIAof75</p>
<p class="m">We can see here that the thread was supposedly created on 27th November 2008 by Red_Penguin, and then approved by Commander. As shown in sheep's screenshot, Red_Penguin's account was not created until 5th December 2018 - over 10 years after the thread was "posted". I think the most likely explanation is that the thread was *not* posted in 2008, but rather more recently - and then someone has modified the "created" value to correspond with 27th November 2008. Especially given that Commander is the one who approved it; surely if it had really been created in 2008, a moderator would have approved it at the time. Commander didn't join the game until 2018.</p>
<p class="m">That's my only theory about it right now. Of course, another possibility is that the mysterious Red Penguin can go back in time :P</p>

<p class="m">The winter collection does not include either of the two hacker colours. Though I agree that two of the winter paints (#4a67fe and #a2c4ff) can sometimes look like the hacker colours when contrasting with certain other paints. As I write this, you are using "#4a67fe" colour. The hacker colours are "#40318d" and "#7869c4".</p>
<p class="m">If you'd like to see a comparison, here's link to a design on IronVault:</p>
<p class="m">https://ironvault.vercel.app/garage/design/----0x4a67fe-0x7869c4-0x40318d</p>
<p class="m">The base and treads in the design are the two hacker colours, while the turret is the colour that you are currently using.</p>

<p class="m">You should be able to change most of the website to a dark theme. In the main Addons menu, there is an option that says "Light" and an option that says "Dark". This controls the theme of most of the website, but not the maze. To make the maze dark, select "Dark" in the resource packs menu.</p>

As for playing the game, it's quite varied, but I'd say most days it's probably anything between 15 minutes and 2 hours (though not all at once). This is just a guess.</p>

<p class="m">1. I think this would be a privacy risk. Obviously people wouldn't need to use it, but I think the in-game chat is adequate, and anything further wouldn't be right for TankTrouble.</p>
<p class="m">2. Unfortunately, this would lead to a lot of scams. I also think the general idea of "trading" doesn't really fit well with TT.</p>

<p class="m">If they were visible in the shop, I could check the code and tell you the exact date and time that they will release. Unfortunately, they aren't visible (which is weird because the summer and winter paints are set to always be visible). Maybe someone else knows how to find the code. However, I was informed by the developers that all 3 sets of paints will be available every year. The spring paints appeared this year on 29th April, so it could *potentially* be the same date again next year. But as Tigers786 said, it will be sometime in Spring... although, maybe not, because the Summer colours didn't release until Autumn :P</p>

<p class="m">To answer your specific questions...</p>
<p class="m">"Why is there no immediate action taken?" - moderators can't be online all the time, so unfortunately action can't always be taken immediately. My advice would be to report the message, and the mods will deal with it when they review the chat messages.</p>
<p class="m">"How will [it] be prevented in the future?" - unfortunately, I don't really think there is anything anyone can do to actually *prevent* messages like these from being posted. Just try to ignore them. There's even a feature you can use that will hide any messages from a specific user.</p>
<p class="m">"Why do other people who are online not take action?" - it depends what "action" you are suggesting, but the only action that regular players can take is to report the message. Only moderators can carry out actions such as a temp ban, etc.</p>

<p class="m">I don't know if you are aware of this, but there is a whistle icon beside every chat message. If you click it, it will report the message to the moderators. It's unfortunate that some people say these things in the chat, but I would recommend that you click the whistle on these messages, and then they will be dealt with by moderators.</p>

<p class="m">The dimitrium spawns have nothing to do with whether players have collected any recently or not. In any given server, dimitrium will spawn in all games at once. As there is a minimum of 100 seconds between spawns in a server, it is statistically beneficial to switch servers after obtaining one; however, that is only statistical, as one server's spawns have no impact on the other servers. And if, as you said, you want an answer from a mod, you might like to read this thread, where it has been confirmed by SavageAimbot: https://tanktrouble.com/forum?threadId=469168</p>

<p class="m">There are indeed a few versions of the game</p>
<p class="m">- This game (tanktrouble.com) is the main game. I guess you could call it the "real" game. It's the original, created by purup and bbc.</p>
<p class="m">- TankTrouble3D is a game which is *based* on TankTrouble. Personally, I would not call it a "version" though. It is endorsed by purup and bbc, although they are not the developers of TT3D.</p>
<p class="m">- There used to be (and may still be) licensed "copies" of the old TankTrouble Classic hosted on other websites. These are legitimate, as the Classic site had a feature to embed the game onto other websites.</p>
<p class="m">- There are also illegal copies of TankTrouble on other websites, where the code has been copied illegally, or are otherwise hosting a form of TankTrouble, without the proper permission of purup and bbc.</p>
<p class="m">- There may also be variations of TankTrouble, hosted on other websites, where they have possibly replicated the idea of the game, but made it slightly different etc. I don't know the legality of that scenario.</p>

<p class="m">Yes, I think if you are verified then your tank will not be affected by mass deletions. But I'm not completely sure.</p>
<p class="m">I think to avoid deletion, your tank needs to either:</p>
<p class="m">1. Have a verified email</p>
<p class="m">2. Have logged in within the past year</p>
<p class="m">I think if either of these apply to your tank, you will be fine. But just to make sure, you should probably do both.</p>

<p class="m">Not necessarily. Earlier this year, the developers deleted all unverified accounts that had been inactive for a year or longer. So to make sure an account doesn't get deleted, it's probably a good idea to have a verified email, and log in at least once a year.</p>

<p class="m">They are not technically related. Kills is the number of times your bullet has hit another tank, and rank is gained by winning "ranked games". When creating a new game, you have the option of making it a ranked game, or leaving it as unranked. So technically a tank could have 0 kills and be on Mad Scientist rank, while another tank could have a million kills and be on the lowest rank.</p>

<p class="m">We aren't allowed to share the exact method. The achievement says you need to "outsmart a bunch of homing missiles". You could create a game with just missiles (if you have premium), and try a few different methods, to see if you get it. Otherwise, just try to use missiles as much as you can to maximise your chances of getting the achievement.</p>

<p class="m">@Blaze-X Yeah. But I am certain that nothing "created" the first thing, if such a thing exists, because if it did, *it* would be the first thing. That sequence could go on forever (backwards), and therefore, "the first thing" was not created by anything else. So yeah, if the big bang was the first thing, we can definitely say that nothing caused it. It just happened of its own accord. Or the alternative is that something did cause it - but if that is the case, then we can't state that the big bang was the first thing.</p>

<p class="m">@Blaze-X Does everything have to be caused/created by something else though? If it does, then the universe has therefore existed forever - because we would never find the root cause, as there would have to be something preceding it. Therefore, if the universe has not existed forever, then some things are just naturally in existence, without having been caused by something else.</p>

<p class="m">@Silent5X I don't think it has a fixed price; when it first appeared in the shop it claimed to cost 25000 coins, although I don't think it actually did. (There was a lot of confusion about that at the time!). It certainly wasn't that price when it appeared a few months ago. I guess it just depends what the developers decide at the time.</p>

<p class="m">@kamarov Apparently there is a global outage in Cloudflare which has caused lots of websites to stop working.

<p class="m">@Blaze-X and @Commander I guess it also could depend what we mean by "before". If there was no time before the big bang - i.e. the big bang was the beginning of time - then there is no such thing as "before the big bang", so there was neither something, nor "nothing". And also, if there was absolutely nothing, not even empty space, before the big bang (so no universe), where and how did the big bang appear?</p>

<p class="m">I don't know if that is possible. And to use this "offline file", would you still be connected to the internet? If not, the forum certainly wouldn't work, as there would be no way of obtaining new threads etc. I would also advise you to check the legality of such a thing, as some things are copyrighted and illegal to create copies of. This may depend on what country you are in, and I don't know whether it applies to TankTrouble or not.</p>

<p class="m">Laika only joins when there is an insufficient number of people to start a round. However, once she joins, she won't leave until the maximum number of players in the round has been exceeded. For example, if you start a regular 6-player classic game, with just one account, Laika will join immediately. She will leave when there are 7 or more players in the game at the end of the round.</p>

<p class="m">@Yellowolf Moderators aren't responsible for lab messages. It is the developers who respond to them. Regarding your second point - I personally think that would be very difficult. That would require detailed coordination between the moderators, making it mandatory for them to be active for specific periods of time on specific days. I think that would be an infringement on their personal lives. Since there are 7 servers, that would mean that at any given time, there would need to be at least 7 moderators online. There are 24 hours in a day, and there are 25 moderators. Let's say there was 21 mods active on one particular day, that would mean on average each of them would have to work an 8-hour "shift". Remember they don't get paid for this! They have their own lives, and I don't think it's fair for a moderator to be obliged to be online for 8 full hours in a day.</p>

<p class="m">You can't get any achievements on a local game. Similarly, you can't get any kills, victories, rank, coins or dimitrium in local game. I think this is to prevent cheating. All 51 in-game achievements can only be obtained in an online game. There are a further 7 achievements that are not related to gameplay.</p>

They can approve or reject usernames, they can ban a player from posting for 12 hours, they can ban/unban a player from logging in, they can lock/unlock threads, pin/unpin threads, view all chat messages, refund items, promote/demote users, and more. However, not all moderators can do all these things. There are different levels of moderator, from GM1 to GM6. The higher their level, the more abilities they have. The developers are GM9, and they can do a lot more things.</p>

<p class="m">@Blaze-X There are some galaxies that can be seen from earth, which are so far away that what we see is what they looked like billions of years ago. This is because the light takes that long to travel here. Even if we could somehow disappear from wherever we are, and instantly appear on that galaxy, we would no longer be seeing what it looked like billions of years ago - we would see it as it is today. That is one of the reasons why it would not be possible, assuming that's the kind of thing you meant.</p>

<p class="m">I can see that this could be an ambiguous question. There are 47 accessories which are not paints. There are also the three paints mentioned by TripleStryke. If we were including paints, we would also need to include the 9 standard Christmas colours, meaning 12 paints in total, and 59 "items" in total. Since it may not have been clear whether the question referred to all Christmas items or just "Christmas objects", I think either answer (47 or 59) would be acceptable. I will therefore award 3 points to @Galatasaray.</p>

<p class="m">Yes, that's correct. It enables you to move your tank in an unorthodox way, impacting the actual gameplay, as it's not available without using addons etc. Orc, you said it's not the "speed hack", but I would say it partially is, as you can move your tank faster than what is intended. But indeed, earlier this year, the admins introduced a new rule that anyone using any "hacks" that affect the game will receive a permanent ban. The classic mouse was discussed as part of that. Here is the thread, if you're interested: https://tanktrouble.com/forum?threadId=469311</p>

<p class="m">I think that would have very bad consequences. There would be a lot more scams, i.e. scammers promising dimi in return for something, and then not giving it. I think it would also be used to bribe people into breaking certain rules. It would lead to a lot of problems, and it's not worth it, in my opinion.</p>

<p class="m">I agree with Dalek-Buster. I've been playing this game for over 7 years - I have never received a temp ban, and I have never used "vulgar language". I honestly don't think there's any need for anyone to be toxic in this game. And of course, the crucial thing is that this is a rule created by the developers. They own this game - so if we are playing their game, we should abide by their rules.</p>

<p class="m">I'm seeing a lot of posts declaring that "everyone has left". Similarly that the game is "dead". Indeed, the game is less active than it used to be, but in my view it is still very much alive. The community is still very active in the forum (and I've been playing since 2018 so I know what I'm comparing it against). In my opinion, it would be better to focus on ideas for making the game more active again, and encouraging forum games and community activities such as Clan Games, rather than complaining "the game is dead". I'm aware that this isn't really related to this thread, but I have seen such messages in this thread, so I thought it would be best to post this here.</p>

<p class="m">@Shfoo77 Spiros04 has two different blue paints. The one on his treads (wheels) is the "Sea Camo Paint", which is available regularly in the shop. The one on his base is from the Eid Box, which is available during Eid. AlexRider is also using two different blue paints. The one on his base is from the Eid box, and the one on his turret is usually available around New Year.</p>

<p class="m">@Shfoo77 I don't know exactly which dark blue paint you mean. There is a dark blue/purple colour, which is from the hacker box, also known as the glitch box. There are also some old blue colours that haven't been available for a long time - these are the "Winter Colours" and will be released at the beginning of 2026. Regarding the paints that look different depending where you see the tank (including the absolute pure black "#000000"), these are illegitimate colours that have been acquired by using exploits.</p>

<p class="m">Tank destruction has increased. 1,656,970 tanks were destroyed in September, which is 291,727 more than in the previous month.</p>
<p class="m">Account creation is also rising. There were 84,760 new accounts created in September, that's 20,079 more than August.</p>

The grey glasses were only obtainable in TankTrouble Classic, and was the reward for an achievement called "Advocate Of Destruction". The smaller glasses are a reward for an achievement called "Old Broken Record", which also gives you a hat. The achievement is obtained by being a regular contributor on the forum.</p>

<p class="m">The one where you shoot 250 tanks with the homing missile? I don't have it either, I'm on 213. But honestly, there's not much point in specifically *attempting* to get it - after all, you'll get it eventually anyway. I still need the achievements for shooting 250 tanks with the gatling gun, missile, and traps. So I sometimes create games with just these 3 weapons. I guess you could make a game with just missiles, then you might get it quicker. But in general, there's no rush, just get it naturally :D</p>

<p class="m">In my experience, moderators are always kind and helpful. Whenever I've needed to ask them something, they've always answered my questions, and they've always given good advice. From what I've seen on the forum, they always seem to be friendly towards everyone. I can't think of any example where I personally have been dissatisfied with their response. I'm sure others may disagree, but from what I've seen, they always explain and justify their actions when questioned. That's as it should be, as it's important to be accountable for any actions taken. Overall, I am satisfied with the way things are handled by the moderation team. Of course, many things were brought to light earlier this year, in Mud's document. I appreciate the efforts of the team to undergo the reformation that has been talked about. I also am grateful to them for their dedication to moderating, as everyone has their own lives as well, and it's important to remember that.</p>

I don't know if anyone still uses any hacks, but if they do, it's only a few people. So if what you're seeing is "almost all" level 20 tanks, that's not cheating.</p>

<p class="m">Of course it's unfair for judges to be able to vote for themselves - as they could be biased and rate themselves very highly.</p>
<p class="m">But, as Mashin says, it does seem unfair for them not to. There are currently 18 participants, and 6 judges. 5 of the judges are also participating. If each judge is rating all tanks from 1-10, but not rating their own tank at all, then the other 13 participants can receive a maximum of 60 points each. But any judge participating can only receive 50 points. (Because a non-judge will get rated by 6 people, but a judge only gets rated by 5 people)</p>
<p class="m">I have a suggestion which could make it a bit more fair. You could extrapolate the points the judges receive by adding the average they received from each of the other judges.</p>
<p class="m">So if a judge received 40 points, they would instead receive 48 points (40 + [40 divided by 5])</p>

Also, you should probably say that participants need to confirm on the forum, after they submit it, to verify that it is them.</p>

<p class="m">Accounts are not "protected" from the scrapper, regardless of whether items have been purchased or not. There isn't a specific time limit, it's just whenever the developers decide to conduct a mass deletion. However, when they do, it's usually accounts that have been inactive for a year or more that get scrapped.</p>

<p class="m">"66222 new tanks were created" may be slightly misleading. 66222 is the net increase of "Tank Owners" from the start of July to the end of July. And of course, the number will also have been impacted by account deletions. So the actual number of new ACCOUNTS created in July will be</p>
<p class="m">66222 + [number of accounts scrapped in July] + [number of guests deleted in July] minus [number of guests created in July]</p>

    <p class="m">Milestone threads are often deleted because they don't follow the criteria for milestone threads. Only threads that are celebrating certain milestones such as 5k, 10k, 15k, 20k etc are allowed. This may be the reason if it was deleted. (I'm not a moderator so of course I don't know for sure, but I'd say that's the most likely reason.)</p>

    <p class="m">@D_A_D from my understanding, there will be 10 days of competition. It's not a knockout tournament, you just have to get as many kills and wins as you can. A win is worth 2 kills. At the end of each day, whoever got the most kills/wins that day will get 4 points (if there are 4 people), 2nd will get 3 points etc. If you don't get any kills/wins that day though, you don't get any points. (At least that's what I think it means)</p>

    <p class="m">I don't think there is any automatic process that will scrap inactive accounts. However, sometimes the developers decide to invoke a mass scrapping, where all inactive accounts are deleted. The most recent example of this was in April. In that recent case, accounts were scrapped if they had not been logged into for more than a year, AND they had no verified email.</p>

The most recent time was in 2019 - the release of Laika. That's when I got it.

    <p class="m">Such questions "What was the previous name of..." could be quite difficult to answer, depending on how well-known the player is. These questions could be interpreted as going against the rule stating that people must reasonably be expected to know the answer. However, how well-known a player is is simply a matter of opinion. So, from this point forward, questions asking about previous names of players will not be allowed. However, Blaze-X's question will be allowed, as it was posted before the implementation of this rule.</p>

    <p class="m">Signups for Classic closed on 8th June. If you signed up since then, I think it will not count. If you remember, could you confirm roughly what date you signed up on? As I said, entries for the next gamemode (weapons) will open sometime after the Classic final.</p>
<p class="m">For each match, the TTOC Crew will organise your match time, and decide what server the match will be played on. This will usually be a server that will be fair for both players.</p>

    <p class="m">The C icon is nothing to do with TTOC. It shows who has played TankTrouble Classic, and how much exp they had. TankTrouble Classic was a version of TankTrouble, which came before the current online version. You could only play against Laika, or against people on the same computer. It closed a few years ago, due to Adobe Flash ending. It's just a coincidence that "Classic" is also the name of the TTOC gamemode.</p>

    <p class="m">@Sir_ Minor correction - The "C" icon in Addons search/IronVault shows how much exp the player had in TankTrouble Classic. If a player made their account before beta was released, they will have the "C" badge. However, if their account was created after beta was released, they will *only* have the badge if they played at least one game on TankTrouble Classic.</p>

    <p class="m">There are two types of bans:</p>
<p class="m">- Temporary bans</p>
<p class="m">This is where you cannot send chat messages, make forum threads, or reply to threads for 12 hours. The ban will end 12 hours after it was given.</p>
<p class="m">- Permanent bans</p>
<p class="m">If you get a "permanent ban", you will be unable to log into your account at all. Your account is basically blocked. This will last until a moderator unbans you. However, as the name suggests, an unban will typically not happen.</p>

There used to be an "embed" feature in TankTrouble Classic, which would allow other people to legitimately embed the game on their own website. However, as you say, there were also some illegal copies, where the code had been modified. In my opinion, action should be taken to remove any illegal copies.</p>

    <p class="m">@heckerwastaken There isn't really a comparison between a mile time and a 5k time. (And yes, 5k is 3.1 miles.)</p>
<p class="m">A lot of people who are good at running a mile won't necessarily be a great 5k runner. Likewise, the best 5k runners might not do so well in a mile.</p>
<p class="m">For example - my mile time is around 5:10. If you extrapolate that to a 5k, it would be around 15 minutes. However, it doesn't work that way. My 5k time is just under 19 minutes. Generally, for any runner, the longer the distance, the slower the pace.</p>

    <p class="m">Everyone is saying it's a Gatling Gun. We will find out soon! I was the first person to say it's a Gatling Gun :P</p>
<p class="m">I'll explain what the Gatling Gun is, in case anyone doesn't know. The Gatling Gun was a weapon in TankTrouble Classic. You had to hold down the shoot button, i.e. Space/Q/Mouse, although in Classic it was M/Q/Mouse. Then, approximately 1 second later, it would shoot loads of tiny bullets, and it would keep doing it until it runs out, or when you stop pressing shoot.</p>
<p class="m">It will certainly be interesting to see what it will be like now, if indeed that's what it is. Maybe it's just a coffee machine :P</p>

    <p class="m">We can see in the blueprint that there are 6 barrels. That could suggest that it will fire lots of bullets at the same time. Then it also mentions "12000 RPM". This indicates something rotating very fast.</p>

    <p class="m">Why would another tank joining and killing Laika reset the count? Space Scrap says you have to kill Laika 25 times in a row without dying. A Laika suicide also shouldn't reset.</p>
      <p class="m">As far as I am aware, the only thing that can reset it is if your tank is destroyed at any point during the 25 kills (or changing servers etc.)</p>
<p class="m">If this is not the case, then the description for the achievement would be inaccurate :P</p>

    <p class="m">There are two main reasons why you shouldn't share accounts.</p>
<p class="m">1. Your account could get stolen.</p>
<p class="m">2. It's against the rules.</p>
<p class="m">---------</p>
<p class="m">Here are two scenarios of what might happen:</p>
<p class="m">1. You share your account, and the other person doesn't buy you the backer box. They don't give you your account back. This means you have lost your account, and potentially never get it back.</p>
<p class="m">2. You share your account, and the other person buys the backer box. They return the account to you. The moderators find out, and permanently ban your account. Then the backer box is no use to you anyway.</p>

    <p class="m">I think if Laika stopped moving for 60 seconds, she would be kicked, same as any other player. Assuming there are no other players, you would then win that round.</p>
      <p class="m">Then when the next round starts, you would be the only player. Which means Laika would immediately join.</p>
<p class="m">If Laika got perm banned, I guess she wouldn't be able to join any games. In which case, it would just be like it was before the devs released Laika to TT beta. When you create a new game, it will say "Waiting for more players" just like it does in deathmatch.</p>

    <p class="m">I think it would be too difficult to do that, as it would require two versions - one with normal TT links, and one with cdn links. However, with any link to a thread, the URL is the same apart from the first bit.</p>
<p class="m">e.g. if the normal link is https://tanktrouble.com/forum?threadId=468881 then the cdn link will be https://cdn.tanktrouble.com/forum?threadId=468881</p>
<p class="m">I think the best way round this is to copy the link and add "cdn." in the URL.</p>

    <p class="m">@ImmortalCyborg Commander can't add a maze creator for use in actual games. Similarly, he can't change Laika's difficulty (in actual games).</p>
<p class="m">The things commander has done are only changing what the website looks like for the user. He can't actually change the game itself.</p>
<p class="m">Also, regarding the maze creator, the devs have said that they will bring it back eventually.</p>

    <p class="m">Obviously you are aware of this, but if you purchase TankTrouble Premium, you can choose which game-mode to use.</p>
<p class="m">Deathmatch adds an interesting challenge to the game, because you may have to use different tactics when playing. Furthermore, having two gamemodes incentivises people to buy TankTrouble Premium, so that they can then choose which to play.</p>
<p class="m">My personal view is that Last Tank Standing is better, although I don't mind playing deathmatch.</p>
