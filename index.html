    <p class="m">Obviously you are aware of this, but if you purchase TankTrouble Premium, you can choose which game-mode to use.</p>
<p class="m">Deathmatch adds an interesting challenge to the game, because you may have to use different tactics when playing. Furthermore, having two gamemodes incentivises people to buy TankTrouble Premium, so that they can then choose which to play.</p>
<p class="m">My personal view is that Last Tank Standing is better, although I don't mind playing deathmatch.</p>

    <p class="m">This could be because they changed their name, or because their account has been scrapped.</p>
      <p class="m">The list of moderators on the wall of fame has not been updated for a while, and many new moderators aren't on it.</p>
        <p class="m">It also hasn't been updated to reflect some name changes of current moderators.</p>
        <p class="m">So, the most likely thing is either they changed their name, or have deleted their account.<p>

    <p class="m">Welcome :)</p>
<p class="m">There are some secret achievements, but I can't tell you exactly how to get them.</p>
<p class="m">There is an achievement that gives you a tinfoil hat, this can be achieved by "following the red penguin".</p>
<p class="m">There is a red penguin logo accessory which can by achieved by "following the red penguin" in a different order, and knocking on Red Penguin's door.</p>
<p class="m">There is a black bow tie, which can be obtained by defeating a "real mad scientist"</p>
<p class="m">There is a pac-mac flag. (Not too difficult to figure that one out)</p>
<p class="m">Good Luck!<p>
