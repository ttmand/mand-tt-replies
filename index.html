    <p class="m">TTOC 2025 Classic has already started. Keep an eye on the "unofficial forum" for any announcements: https://forum.ttoc.ca</p>
<p class="m">And here's the link to the Classic bracket: https://brackethq.com/b/0vupc/</p>

    <p class="m">The C icon is nothing to do with TTOC. It shows who has played TankTrouble Classic, and how much exp they had. TankTrouble Classic was a version of TankTrouble, which came before the current online version. You could only play against Laika, or against people on the same computer. It closed a few years ago, due to Adobe Flash ending. It's just a coincidence that "Classic" is also the name of the TTOC gamemode.</p>

    <p class="m">@Sir_ Minor correction - The "C" icon in Addons search/IronVault shows how much exp the player had in TankTrouble Classic. If a player made their account before beta was released, they will have the "C" badge. However, if their account was created after beta was released, they will *only* have the badge if they played at least one game on TankTrouble Classic.</p>
<p class="m">@Blaze-X From what I can see, there is only one confirmation from you that you entered. After which, TripleStryke declared that your entry had not been received.</p>

    <p class="m">There is a TTOC paint, which is kind of purple. This will be on sale during TTOC season.</p>
<p class="m">However, I think you are probably referring to the "Glitch paints". There used to be a box in TankTrouble Classic containing glitchy accessories and two shades of purple paint. It is no longer available, since Classic closed.</p>

    <p class="m">There are two types of bans:</p>
<p class="m">- Temporary bans</p>
<p class="m">This is where you cannot send chat messages, make forum threads, or reply to threads for 12 hours. The ban will end 12 hours after it was given.</p>
<p class="m">- Permanent bans</p>
<p class="m">If you get a "permanent ban", you will be unable to log into your account at all. Your account is basically blocked. This will last until a moderator unbans you. However, as the name suggests, an unban will typically not happen.</p>

There used to be an "embed" feature in TankTrouble Classic, which would allow other people to legitimately embed the game on their own website. However, as you say, there were also some illegal copies, where the code had been modified. In my opinion, action should be taken to remove any illegal copies.</p>

    <p class="m">The scrapyard hit 3 billion in September 2022. That was nearly three years ago, and it's gone up 6.2% of the next billion in that time.</p> 
      <p class="m">It will need to do that approximately 16.1 more times to reach 4 billion, meaning if it continues the rate it's going, it should reach 4 billion in 2070. That's 48 years per billion, so it should reach 9,999,999,999 in the year 2358.</p>
      <p class="m">Very complicated answer, and I might have got it wrong :P</p>

    <p class="m">@Zys Yes, there was a "crisis" when Laika was introduced to online. Although in that crisis, it was not called "suit up", it was called "Laika On The Loose".</p>
      <p class="m">It wasn't the first crisis, but there hasn't been one since.</p>
<p class="m">@Hafiz The hazmat suit *may* be available again in the future, but for a different reason than the last time, so it probably won't be called "Laika On The Loose" :P</p>

    <p class="m">There are two main reasons why you shouldn't share accounts.</p>
<p class="m">1. Your account could get stolen.</p>
<p class="m">2. It's against the rules.</p>
<p class="m">---------</p>
<p class="m">Here are two scenarios of what might happen:</p>
<p class="m">1. You share your account, and the other person doesn't buy you the backer box. They don't give you your account back. This means you have lost your account, and potentially never get it back.</p>
<p class="m">2. You share your account, and the other person buys the backer box. They return the account to you. The moderators find out, and permanently ban your account. Then the backer box is no use to you anyway.</p>

      <p class="m">Then when the next round starts, you would be the only player. Which means Laika would immediately join.</p>
<p class="m">If Laika got perm banned, I guess she wouldn't be able to join any games. In which case, it would just be like it was before the devs released Laika to TT beta. When you create a new game, it will say "Waiting for more players" just like it does in deathmatch.</p>

    <p class="m">I think it would be too difficult to do that, as it would require two versions - one with normal TT links, and one with cdn links. However, with any link to a thread, the URL is the same apart from the first bit.</p>
<p class="m">e.g. if the normal link is https://tanktrouble.com/forum?threadId=468881 then the cdn link will be https://cdn.tanktrouble.com/forum?threadId=468881</p>

    <p class="m">This could be because they changed their name, or because their account has been scrapped.</p>
      <p class="m">The list of moderators on the wall of fame has not been updated for a while, and many new moderators aren't on it.</p>
        <p class="m">It also hasn't been updated to reflect some name changes of current moderators.</p>
        <p class="m">So, the most likely thing is either they changed their name, or have deleted their account.<p>
