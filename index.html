<p class="m">Being "unimportant" is subjective and I don't think posts are likely to be deleted because of it. If your post was deleted, it could be because it broke one of the TankTrouble rules. If you don't know them, I would recommend reading them, and it might give you some more insight as to why your post was deleted. You can read them here: https://tinyurl.com/ttrulesdoc</p>

<p class="m">We can't reveal the exact methods, but I would suggest creating a game with just the gatling gun and the homing missile. Or if you don't have premium, try to use these weapons as much as possible. Then just try a few things with these weapons, and you might get them! Remember, the achievement descriptions are clues, so try to figure out what they mean.</p>

<p class="m">Yes, that's correct. It enables you to move your tank in an unorthodox way, impacting the actual gameplay, as it's not available without using addons etc. Orc, you said it's not the "speed hack", but I would say it partially is, as you can move your tank faster than what is intended. But indeed, earlier this year, the admins introduced a new rule that anyone using any "hacks" that affect the game will receive a permanent ban. The classic mouse was discussed as part of that. Here is the thread, if you're interested: https://tanktrouble.com/forum?threadId=469311</p>

<p class="m">I think that would have very bad consequences. There would be a lot more scams, i.e. scammers promising dimi in return for something, and then not giving it. I think it would also be used to bribe people into breaking certain rules. It would lead to a lot of problems, and it's not worth it, in my opinion.</p>

<p class="m">I agree with Dalek-Buster. I've been playing this game for over 7 years - I have never received a temp ban, and I have never used "vulgar language". I honestly don't think there's any need for anyone to be toxic in this game. And of course, the crucial thing is that this is a rule created by the developers. They own this game - so if we are playing their game, we should abide by their rules.</p>

<p class="m">I'm seeing a lot of posts declaring that "everyone has left". Similarly that the game is "dead". Indeed, the game is less active than it used to be, but in my view it is still very much alive. The community is still very active in the forum (and I've been playing since 2018 so I know what I'm comparing it against). In my opinion, it would be better to focus on ideas for making the game more active again, and encouraging forum games and community activities such as Clan Games, rather than complaining "the game is dead". I'm aware that this isn't really related to this thread, but I have seen such messages in this thread, so I thought it would be best to post this here.</p>

I don't know which turquoise paint you mean, but it's most likely from the Spring box or the Winter box. Also, I don't know exactly what you mean by "lavender paint", but I'd guess you mean the light paint from the hacker box. Unfortunately, that's no longer available.</p>

<p class="m">@Shfoo77 I don't know exactly which dark blue paint you mean. There is a dark blue/purple colour, which is from the hacker box, also known as the glitch box. There are also some old blue colours that haven't been available for a long time - these are the "Winter Colours" and will be released at the beginning of 2026. Regarding the paints that look different depending where you see the tank (including the absolute pure black "#000000"), these are illegitimate colours that have been acquired by using exploits.</p>

<p class="m">Tank destruction has increased. 1,656,970 tanks were destroyed in September, which is 291,727 more than in the previous month.</p>
<p class="m">Account creation is also rising. There were 84,760 new accounts created in September, that's 20,079 more than August.</p>

The smaller glasses are a reward for an achievement called "Old Broken Record", which also gives you a hat. The achievement is obtained by being a regular contributor on the forum.</p>

But honestly, there's not much point in specifically *attempting* to get it - after all, you'll get it eventually anyway. I still need the achievements for shooting 250 tanks with the gatling gun, missile, and traps. So I sometimes create games with just these 3 weapons. I guess you could make a game with just missiles, then you might get it quicker. But in general, there's no rush, just get it naturally :D</p>

<p class="m">In my experience, moderators are always kind and helpful. Whenever I've needed to ask them something, they've always answered my questions, and they've always given good advice. From what I've seen on the forum, they always seem to be friendly towards everyone. I can't think of any example where I personally have been dissatisfied with their response. I'm sure others may disagree, but from what I've seen, they always explain and justify their actions when questioned. That's as it should be, as it's important to be accountable for any actions taken. Overall, I am satisfied with the way things are handled by the moderation team. Of course, many things were brought to light earlier this year, in Mud's document. I appreciate the efforts of the team to undergo the reformation that has been talked about. I also am grateful to them for their dedication to moderating, as everyone has their own lives as well, and it's important to remember that.</p>

<p class="m">@Astrality it's called "Random Discussion" because it's the only thread in which we can discuss things not related to TankTrouble. But the politics rule is there to prevent arguments, which is still important in the Random Discussion.</p>

<p class="m">@ic803 As SavageAimbot said, the reason politics isn't allowed is to avoid "arguing and escalation". People have differences of opinion on the matter, and if it was discussed here, it could easily lead to arguments.</p>

<p class="m">It's almost certainly not cheating. Using any hacks/cheats was banned earlier this year. Anyone who uses them is supposed to get a permanent ban. I don't know if anyone still uses any hacks, but if they do, it's only a few people. So if what you're seeing is "almost all" level 20 tanks, that's not cheating.</p>

<p class="m">Of course it's unfair for judges to be able to vote for themselves - as they could be biased and rate themselves very highly.</p>
<p class="m">But, as Mashin says, it does seem unfair for them not to. There are currently 18 participants, and 6 judges. 5 of the judges are also participating. If each judge is rating all tanks from 1-10, but not rating their own tank at all, then the other 13 participants can receive a maximum of 60 points each. But any judge participating can only receive 50 points. (Because a non-judge will get rated by 6 people, but a judge only gets rated by 5 people)</p>
<p class="m">I have a suggestion which could make it a bit more fair. You could extrapolate the points the judges receive by adding the average they received from each of the other judges.</p>
<p class="m">So if a judge received 40 points, they would instead receive 48 points (40 + [40 divided by 5])</p>

<p class="m">248 new threads were created in August. This is 13 less than the previous month.</p>
<p class="m">1365243 tanks were destroyed in the mazes. This is also a sharp decrease of 170975, compared to July.</p>
<p class="m">The number of new accounts has also decreased. 64681 new tanks were created in August - this is 1541 less than in July</p>
<p class="m">So that is a decline in numbers for all 3 statistics... hopefully they will improve soon!</p>

And it requires people to sign in. It's possible to create a google form that doesn't require login, and doesn't require email addresses. Also, you should probably say that participants need to confirm on the forum, after they submit it, to verify that it is them.</p>

<p class="m">Accounts are not "protected" from the scrapper, regardless of whether items have been purchased or not.

However, when they do, it's usually accounts that have been inactive for a year or more that get scrapped.</p>

<p class="m">"66222 new tanks were created" may be slightly misleading. 66222 is the net increase of "Tank Owners" from the start of July to the end of July. And of course, the number will also have been impacted by account deletions. So the actual number of new ACCOUNTS created in July will be</p>
<p class="m">66222 + [number of accounts scrapped in July] + [number of guests deleted in July] minus [number of guests created in July]</p>
<p class="m">but of course we don't know what these numbers are :P</p>
<p class="m">also, just for clarity regarding the other statistics I mentioned...</p>
<p class="m">"1536218" is the difference between the scrapyard at the start of July and the scrapyard at the end of July...</p>
<p class="m">"261" threads is all threads created in July, including deleted threads.</p>

    <p class="m">Milestone threads are often deleted because they don't follow the criteria for milestone threads. Only threads that are celebrating certain milestones such as 5k, 10k, 15k, 20k etc are allowed. This may be the reason if it was deleted.

At the end of each day, whoever got the most kills/wins that day will get 4 points (if there are 4 people), 2nd will get 3 points etc. If you don't get any kills/wins that day though, you don't get any points.

    <p class="m">There's certainly nothing wrong with the thread concept - otherwise the previous thread wouldn't have been approved. I think you would be allowed to create another one. The reason we can't use the previous one is because the last reply was over 7 days ago - and that would be a bump.</p>

    <p class="m">@SharpNitroPelican As Questionable said, the yellow one was available in 2019, when Laika was released to TT Beta. However, it has actually been available a few times. The first time it was available was when the scrapyard reached 1 billion. Since then, it has been available when there is a "crisis" in TankTrouble. The most recent time was in 2019 - the release of Laika. That's when I got it. It hasn't been released since, but to answer your second question - yes, the yellow hazmat suit is permanently in people's garage if they achieved it.</p>

    <p class="m">What do you mean by "cheating"? Recently the devs/mods made a rule that means you aren't allowed to use any in-game hacks, and anyone who does will be permanently banned. I'm not aware of any feature that will kick you out of a game for cheating. However, the game has been updated about 20 minutes ago, so it might be something to do with that.</p>

    <p class="m">Such questions "What was the previous name of..." could be quite difficult to answer, depending on how well-known the player is. These questions could be interpreted as going against the rule stating that people must reasonably be expected to know the answer. However, how well-known a player is is simply a matter of opinion. So, from this point forward, questions asking about previous names of players will not be allowed. However, Blaze-X's question will be allowed, as it was posted before the implementation of this rule.</p>

    <p class="m">The above question/answer is being treated as invalid due to a suspected violation of the "Only one account" rule. After considering the available evidence, I believe this is the best decision to maintain the integrity of the game.</p>

    <p class="m">Signups for Classic closed on 8th June. If you signed up since then, I think it will not count. If you remember, could you confirm roughly what date you signed up on? As I said, entries for the next gamemode (weapons) will open sometime after the Classic final.</p>
<p class="m">For each match, the TTOC Crew will organise your match time, and decide what server the match will be played on. This will usually be a server that will be fair for both players.</p>

It closed a few years ago, due to Adobe Flash ending. It's just a coincidence that "Classic" is also the name of the TTOC gamemode.</p>

    <p class="m">@Sir_ Minor correction - The "C" icon in Addons search/IronVault shows how much exp the player had in TankTrouble Classic. If a player made their account before beta was released, they will have the "C" badge. However, if their account was created after beta was released, they will *only* have the badge if they played at least one game on TankTrouble Classic.</p>
<p class="m">@Blaze-X From what I can see, there is only one confirmation from you that you entered. After which, TripleStryke declared that your entry had not been received.</p>

<p class="m">However, I think you are probably referring to the "Glitch paints". There used to be a box in TankTrouble Classic containing glitchy accessories and two shades of purple paint. It is no longer available, since Classic closed.</p>

    <p class="m">There are two types of bans:</p>
<p class="m">- Temporary bans</p>
<p class="m">This is where you cannot send chat messages, make forum threads, or reply to threads for 12 hours. The ban will end 12 hours after it was given.</p>
<p class="m">- Permanent bans</p>
<p class="m">If you get a "permanent ban", you will be unable to log into your account at all. Your account is basically blocked. This will last until a moderator unbans you. However, as the name suggests, an unban will typically not happen.</p>

The resource packs aren't working properly for me (as mentioned in kamarov's thread), also in the forum, when I try to click on the previous page buttons, back button etc, I'm not able to. When my cursor is in the area, the page just scrolls to the top.</p>

      <p class="m">It will need to do that approximately 16.1 more times to reach 4 billion, meaning if it continues the rate it's going, it should reach 4 billion in 2070. That's 48 years per billion, so it should reach 9,999,999,999 in the year 2358.</p>

    <p class="m">The new gatling gun is an interesting change from the original. In Classic, you lose the gun immediately when you stop firing - but with the new one, we keep it until it runs out of bullets. Personally I think it's better this way.</p>

    <p class="m">@heckerwastaken There isn't really a comparison between a mile time and a 5k time. (And yes, 5k is 3.1 miles.)</p>
<p class="m">A lot of people who are good at running a mile won't necessarily be a great 5k runner. Likewise, the best 5k runners might not do so well in a mile.</p>
<p class="m">For example - my mile time is around 5:10. If you extrapolate that to a 5k, it would be around 15 minutes. However, it doesn't work that way. My 5k time is just under 19 minutes. Generally, for any runner, the longer the distance, the slower the pace.</p>

    <p class="m">Everyone is saying it's a Gatling Gun. We will find out soon! I was the first person to say it's a Gatling Gun :P</p>
<p class="m">I'll explain what the Gatling Gun is, in case anyone doesn't know. The Gatling Gun was a weapon in TankTrouble Classic. You had to hold down the shoot button, i.e. Space/Q/Mouse, although in Classic it was M/Q/Mouse. Then, approximately 1 second later, it would shoot loads of tiny bullets, and it would keep doing it until it runs out, or when you stop pressing shoot.</p>
<p class="m">It will certainly be interesting to see what it will be like now, if indeed that's what it is. Maybe it's just a coffee machine :P</p>

    <p class="m">Why would another tank joining and killing Laika reset the count? Space Scrap says you have to kill Laika 25 times in a row without dying. A Laika suicide also shouldn't reset.</p>
      <p class="m">As far as I am aware, the only thing that can reset it is if your tank is destroyed at any point during the 25 kills (or changing servers etc.)</p>
<p class="m">If this is not the case, then the description for the achievement would be inaccurate :P</p>

<p class="m">Here are two scenarios of what might happen:</p>
<p class="m">1. You share your account, and the other person doesn't buy you the backer box. They don't give you your account back. This means you have lost your account, and potentially never get it back.</p>
<p class="m">2. You share your account, and the other person buys the backer box. They return the account to you. The moderators find out, and permanently ban your account. Then the backer box is no use to you anyway.</p>

    <p class="m">I think if Laika stopped moving for 60 seconds, she would be kicked, same as any other player. Assuming there are no other players, you would then win that round.</p>
      <p class="m">Then when the next round starts, you would be the only player. Which means Laika would immediately join.</p>
<p class="m">If Laika got perm banned, I guess she wouldn't be able to join any games. In which case, it would just be like it was before the devs released Laika to TT beta. When you create a new game, it will say "Waiting for more players" just like it does in deathmatch.</p>

    <p class="m">I think it would be too difficult to do that, as it would require two versions - one with normal TT links, and one with cdn links. However, with any link to a thread, the URL is the same apart from the first bit.</p>
<p class="m">e.g. if the normal link is https://tanktrouble.com/forum?threadId=468881 then the cdn link will be https://cdn.tanktrouble.com/forum?threadId=468881</p>
<p class="m">I think the best way round this is to copy the link and add "cdn." in the URL.</p>

    <p class="m">This could be because they changed their name, or because their account has been scrapped.</p>
      <p class="m">The list of moderators on the wall of fame has not been updated for a while, and many new moderators aren't on it.</p>
        <p class="m">It also hasn't been updated to reflect some name changes of current moderators.</p>
        <p class="m">So, the most likely thing is either they changed their name, or have deleted their account.<p>
